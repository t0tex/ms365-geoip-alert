# MS365 Teams GeoIP Alert

This script monitors Microsoft 365 sign-ins from users in a specific Entra ID group and sends an alert to Microsoft Teams if a login is detected **outside a defined country**. It uses the Microsoft Graph API and Defender XDR (Advanced Hunting) API to track activity, suppress repeat alerts, and provide adaptive card alerts in real time.
